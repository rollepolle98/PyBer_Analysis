# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis 
In this new analysis the purpose is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas. Next with Pandas and Matplotlib, we'll then create a multiple line graph which displays the total weekly fares for each city type. With this analysis and data we'll be able to summarize how the data differs by city type and how the decision-makers at PyBer can use these data formulated to draw conlusions. Then we will go on to use different box plots and pie charts to validate the results we got from the multiple line chart. All of this information combined will help us aid the CEO in adressing any disparities among the city types by being able to summarize three buisness recomendations.


## Results 

### Challenge Summary

* #### We can condlude that Urban cities generate the most revenue comopared to Rural and Suburban.

* ####  This chart clearly displays that drivers in Urban cities recieve a larger amount of rides but at a lower average fair where as Rural city drivers recieve less number of rides but the average fair is much higher and suburban city drivers are the middle ground between the two.

* #### This box-plot clearly shows that Urban cities receieve the most amount of rides with Suburban coming in second and Rural being last.

* #### This box-plot clearly shows that Rural cities receieve the most amount of money per ride with Suburban coming in second and Urban being last.

* #### Based on this box plot it clear that Urban cities have the most drivers with suburban being second and rural having the least amount.
